My first attempt on Heroes of might problem https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1666/H

I tried to run some tests manually, as for this problem the website does not accept virtual submissions

The code seems to work, but it is slow on some cases. I don't think this is due to python, I think I should work on a math
formula that avoids some cycles

To do list:
1)Check memory usage of my script
2)Understand best solutions in C++
